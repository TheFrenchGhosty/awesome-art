# Awesome-Art

A curated list of as much artistic creations (movies/musics/games/books...) that are worth checking.

The point of this project is to curate what's in the lists (IE: not add something because it's popular (example: Marvel Movies/Shows)).

The lists of this project will always be work in progress, because I discover, or remember new things every month.

Feel free to contribute if you know something that's worth adding.
