# Awesome-Art - Shooters (FPS and TPS - Multiplayer and Singleplayer)

This list is the most complete of Awesome-Art for the simple that this is the genre of video games I play/played the most.
It is also a genre that is basically dead (the last great one came out in 2018: "Insurgency - Sandstorm").


Note: Games that are "hybrid" with shooter as a "subgenre" aren't in this list, eg: "Borderlands", because the shooting part is the main part, but "Resident Evil 4" isn't included because it's an horror game first.

DLCs/extensions are considered part of the game.
